# Restaurant Finder around Singapore Management University
By a team of students from SMU :)

First things first! Some context to this project:
Singapore Management University occupies a very central location in Singapore and is surrounded with many shopping malls, coffee shops, hawker centers, and standalone restaurants in all directions! This presents dilemmas to students when it comes to deciding where to eat, especially when they are new to the school and there are a bajillion unexplored choices. Initially we create this app to solve this issue we observed exchange students facing but realized that freshmen entering SMU could have a use for it (as well as veteran SMU students who are looking for new options!) 
But what makes us different from Google Maps? We have filters for Cuisine, Price, and Popularity so students can choose a restaurant that fits their preferences!
